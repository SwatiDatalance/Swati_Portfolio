Apocalypse Dataset:

Determine two things:

Where we are spending the least amount of money buying the exact same product that will help us to determine where we want to shop?
Should I buy all the products at the same place or are there certain products that they are going to be cheaper at a specific store and i should buy it there?

Apocolypse Food Prep - Visualizations :

Now we know that Costco is the place to go for basically every single product except if we're buying rice and if we want to save just a few dollars we're going to head over to Target and this will change my shopping habits for the next several years until the apocalypse happens.
